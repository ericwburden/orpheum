# Product Traceability Check

## Purpose

Validate that the Product Owner artifact chain preserves linkage from validated discovery, feedback, or delivery evidence through product direction, prioritization, review, and handoff.

## Applies To

- Instantiated Product Owner artifact sets
- Use when reviewing whether the product package stays grounded in explicit inputs rather than stakeholder memory or chat context

## Criteria

- Product direction references the validated discovery or evidence inputs that justify it.
- Backlog prioritization is traceable to the product direction and supporting evidence.
- The product decision review references the product direction and prioritization artifacts explicitly.
- The product handoff references the full reviewed product package.
- Material tradeoffs, conditions, and deferred scope remain visible across the chain.
- Enduring product direction remains distinguishable from slice-specific prioritization when those scopes differ.
- Existing behavioral specifications or specification needs are referenced when they materially constrain product choices.

## Scoring Or Outcome

Pass/fail.

## Evidence Required

- The instantiated Product Owner artifact chain
- The upstream discovery, evidence, or specification inputs used by the package

## Supporting Skills

- [`research-documentation`](D:/Projects/orpheum/skills/research-documentation/SKILL.md) when the traceability chain is difficult to follow because the source context is fragmented.
- [`requirements-verification`](D:/Projects/orpheum/skills/requirements-verification/SKILL.md) when linkage back to validated requirements or acceptance commitments is weak.

## Failure Response

- Rework the earliest artifact that dropped traceability rather than patching only the final handoff.
- Route missing discovery or specification clarity upstream instead of inventing traceability after the fact.
