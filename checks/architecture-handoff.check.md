# Architecture Handoff Check

## Purpose

Validate that the architecture handoff is complete enough for downstream roles to continue without reconstructing the solution shape or design rationale from earlier artifacts.

## Applies To

- instantiated copies of [`artifacts/architecture-handoff.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/architecture-handoff.md)
- Use when architecture is being passed to planning, implementation, or verification roles.
- Do not use to validate implementation plans or sprint/task decomposition.

## Criteria

- The architecture being handed off is summarized clearly.
- Review status and material architecture findings are visible.
- Major interface, dependency, or integration hotspots are visible.
- Verification focus areas are explicit.
- Architecture fitness criteria are visible enough to guide downstream verification or planning.
- Unresolved decisions and risks are present.
- Downstream consumers are identified.
- Next decision points are included.
- The handoff does not collapse into implementation planning, task decomposition, or delivery management.

## Scoring Or Outcome

Pass/fail.

The artifact passes only if a downstream technical role can proceed without rediscovering the architecture from earlier notes.

## Evidence Required

- The architecture handoff artifact.
- The solution architecture and architecture decisions artifacts when needed to confirm completeness.

If the handoff depends on implied context not captured in the artifact, fail the check.

## Supporting Skills

- [`architecture-handoff-packaging`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/architecture-handoff-packaging/SKILL.md) when the handoff needs stronger packaging, better hotspot framing, or clearer downstream guidance.
- [`research-documentation`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/research-documentation/SKILL.md) when architecture context is still scattered across local notes.

## Failure Response

- Rework the handoff artifact before passing architecture downstream.
- Keep architecture work open until major risks, decisions, and hotspots are explicit.

## Notes

This check protects the architect-to-downstream boundary by ensuring the handoff is self-sufficient without becoming an implementation plan.
