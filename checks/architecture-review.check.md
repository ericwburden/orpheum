# Architecture Review Check

## Purpose

Validate that the architecture review artifact records a usable readiness judgment, the material findings behind that judgment, and the remediation needed before architecture is handed downstream.

## Applies To

- instantiated copies of [`artifacts/architecture-review.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/architecture-review.md)
- Use after the first architecture design pass and before downstream architecture handoff.
- Do not use as a substitute for validating the underlying architecture artifacts themselves.

## Criteria

- The review scope and reviewed inputs are identified clearly.
- The overall assessment is explicit.
- Readiness or approval status is stated clearly.
- A decision owner or approver is explicit when readiness is not purely self-evident.
- Key findings are visible and materially relevant.
- Interface or contract observations are surfaced when boundary quality is part of the review concern.
- Unresolved risks and questions are explicit.
- Required remediation is routed to the earliest artifact that should be reworked.
- Condition owners are explicit when the review outcome is conditional or blocked.
- The recommended next step is consistent with the actual review outcome.

## Scoring Or Outcome

Pass/fail.

The artifact passes only if a downstream reader can understand whether the architecture is ready, why, and what still needs to change without reconstructing the review from chat context.

## Evidence Required

- The architecture review artifact.
- The reviewed solution architecture and architecture decisions artifacts.
- Any supporting BA or technical references needed to interpret the findings honestly.

If the review artifact does not show how it reached its readiness judgment, fail the check.

## Supporting Skills

- [`architecture-review`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/architecture-review/SKILL.md) when the review artifact needs stronger findings, clearer readiness language, or better remediation routing.
- [`research-documentation`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/research-documentation/SKILL.md) when conflicting technical context needs synthesis before a review judgment can be made honestly.

## Failure Response

- Rework the review artifact before relying on it as the decision point for downstream handoff.
- If the review reveals blocked architecture, route remediation to the earliest design artifact rather than papering over the defect in the review summary.

## Notes

This check protects the review stage from becoming a vague approval ritual. It requires the review to be explicit, durable, and actionable.
