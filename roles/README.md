# Roles

This directory stores reusable role templates and related role-guidance patterns.

Use this area for:

- baseline role templates for new projects
- variants tuned for specific repository types or delivery contexts
- experiments in role operating guidance that may later be standardized

Templates here should favor clarity, reuse, and explicit tradeoffs over project-specific assumptions.

Start from [`role.template.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/roles/role.template.md) when creating a new reusable role definition.

## Concrete Roles

- [`business-analyst.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/roles/business-analyst.md) defines a structured interviewer role for early project discovery, business requirements, and process analysis.
- [`role-builder.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/roles/role-builder.md) defines a meta-role for designing reusable agent roles together with their artifacts, workflows, checks, supporting skills, and adoption handoff.
- [`solution-architect.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/roles/solution-architect.md) defines the architecture role that turns validated requirements into a solution shape, decision record, review outcome, and downstream technical handoff.
- [`technical-planner.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/roles/technical-planner.md) defines the execution-planning role that turns reviewed architecture and validated requirements into an implementation strategy, sequencing plan, reviewed planning package, and downstream implementation handoff.
- [`qa-verification-lead.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/roles/qa-verification-lead.md) defines the verification role that turns reviewed requirements, architecture, planning, and implementation context into a verification strategy, traceable evidence matrix, reviewed readiness judgment, and downstream verification handoff.

Use the Business Analyst role when a project needs help clarifying business goals, documenting as-is and to-be processes, verifying requirements, maintaining traceability, and preparing downstream roles for solutioning without mixing in implementation ownership too early.

Use the Role Builder role when a project needs to define a new reusable agent role or tighten the coherence of an existing role package across its supporting artifacts, workflows, checks, skills, and downstream adoption guidance.

In this repository, `Role Builder hardening pass` is the short trigger phrase for the standard role-package quality review.

Use the Solution Architect role when validated BA outputs need to be turned into an explicit system shape, architectural decisions, integration framing, reviewed readiness, and a downstream technical handoff without collapsing into implementation planning.

Use the Technical Planner role when reviewed architecture and validated requirements need to be turned into an execution-ready implementation strategy, explicit sequencing and dependency handling, reviewed readiness, and a downstream implementation handoff without collapsing into sprint administration or code ownership.

Use the QA / Verification Lead role when reviewed requirements, architecture, planning, and implementation context need to be turned into an evidence-based verification strategy, explicit coverage and gap framing, reviewed readiness, and a downstream verification handoff without collapsing into implementation ownership or release operations.
