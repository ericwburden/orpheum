# Notes

This directory stores structured working notes about agentic delivery practices, lessons learned, open questions, and candidate patterns.

Use this area for:

- observations from project work
- emerging conventions not yet ready to become standards
- comparisons between alternative workflows
- captured lessons that need refinement

Notes here should be explicit enough to revisit later and either promote into standards or discard with clear reasoning.

Start from [`practice-note.template.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/notes/practice-note.template.md) when recording a new lesson or candidate practice.

## Current Notes

- [`sdlc-role-recommendations.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/notes/sdlc-role-recommendations.md) captures the recommended order for building reusable SDLC roles in this repository.
- [`solution-architect-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/notes/solution-architect-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Solution Architect package uses a mix of existing and repo-native skills.
- [`technical-planner-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/notes/technical-planner-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Technical Planner package reuses the existing planning and handoff skills in v1 instead of adding dedicated planner skills immediately.
- [`qa-verification-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/notes/qa-verification-skill-sourcing.md) records why the QA / Verification Lead package reuses the existing verification, synthesis, and handoff skills in v1 instead of adding dedicated verification skills immediately.
- [`implementation-engineer-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/implementation-engineer-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Implementation Engineer package uses a dedicated implementation-packaging skill together with existing synthesis, testing, and handoff support.
- [`code-reviewer-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/code-reviewer-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Code Reviewer package reuses the existing synthesis, requirement-grounding, testing, and handoff skills in its first pass instead of adding a dedicated review skill immediately.
- [`release-handoff-manager-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/release-handoff-manager-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Release / Handoff Manager package reuses the existing synthesis, handoff, and requirement-grounding skills in its first pass instead of adding a dedicated release skill immediately.
- [`product-owner-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/product-owner-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Product Owner package reuses the existing grounding, synthesis, handoff, and Allium-aware skills in its first pass instead of adding a dedicated product-ownership skill immediately.
- [`security-compliance-specialist-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/security-compliance-specialist-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Security / Compliance Specialist package reuses the existing synthesis, grounding, handoff, and Allium-aware skills in its first pass instead of adding a dedicated security/compliance skill immediately.
- [`scenario-designer-skill-sourcing.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/scenario-designer-skill-sourcing.md) records why the Scenario Designer package now uses the dedicated `scenario-composition` skill together with the existing synthesis, adaptation, handoff, and Allium-aware skills, and how public orchestration patterns informed the role shape.
- [`scenario-recommendations.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/notes/scenario-recommendations.md) records the recommended first set of reusable scenarios supported by the current role set and why `Project Planning` should be implemented first.
- [`orpheum-cli-maintainability-issue-set.md`](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/orpheum-cli-maintainability-issue-set.md) turns the recent Rust CLI maintainability review into a sequenced GitHub issue set using the repository's planning scenarios.
- [`orpheum-onboarding-discoverability-plan.md`](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/orpheum-onboarding-discoverability-plan.md) captures a dogfood-based improvement plan for the onboarding, catalog-discovery, and session-state seams that made Orpheum harder for agents to recognize and activate automatically in consumer projects.
- [`orpheum-decision-capture-gap.md`](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/orpheum-decision-capture-gap.md) captures product feedback that Orpheum's current artifact model does not force durable enough capture of locked decisions and architecture constraints, leaving too much decision context in conversation state.
- [`orpheum-semantic-review-phase.md`](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/orpheum-semantic-review-phase.md) captures product feedback that artifact generation plus structural checks are not sufficient for architecture-heavy discovery and planning work, and that human semantic review of artifacts should likely become a first-class scenario phase.
