# Business Analyst Requirements Handoff

## Purpose

Turn discovery and process analysis into verified business requirements and a downstream-ready handoff package for product, architecture, delivery, or implementation roles.

## When To Use

- The business objective and process context are stable enough to express verified requirements.
- Downstream teams need a clean handoff that preserves business rationale, traceability, risks, and unresolved questions.
- The work is ready to move from BA discovery into planning or implementation preparation.

## Inputs

- Required:
  - an instantiated copy of [`artifacts/business-objectives.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/business-objectives.md)
  - an instantiated copy of [`artifacts/process-analysis.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/process-analysis.md)
- Optional: additional research, stakeholder clarifications, policy references, and prior specs.
- Optional: existing Allium specifications or other behavioral specifications.

## Outputs

- Primary artifact types:
  - an instantiated copy of [`artifacts/requirements-specification.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/requirements-specification.md) in the target project workspace
  - an instantiated copy of [`artifacts/requirements-handoff.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/requirements-handoff.md) in the target project workspace
- Secondary outputs: clarified acceptance considerations, candidate Allium promotion notes, and downstream decision framing.

## Skills And Tools

- Repo-native synthesis from the Business Analyst artifacts as the default path.
- [`research-documentation`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/research-documentation/SKILL.md) when additional evidence or clarification is needed before finalizing requirements.
- [`requirements-verification`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/requirements-verification/SKILL.md) to determine which requirements are actually supported and strengthen the requirements specification artifact.
- [`handoff-packaging`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/handoff-packaging/SKILL.md) to package verified requirements into a downstream-ready handoff with traceability, risks, and decision points.
- [`allium`](C:/Users/ericw/.codex/skills/allium/SKILL.md), [`elicit`](C:/Users/ericw/.codex/skills/allium/skills/elicit/SKILL.md), or [`tend`](C:/Users/ericw/.codex/skills/allium/skills/tend/SKILL.md) only when the verified behavior is stable enough to be promoted into or reconciled against a specification.
- [`spec-to-implementation`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/spec-to-implementation/SKILL.md) only after the BA handoff is mature enough to support downstream planning translation.

## Sequence

1. Read the business objectives and process analysis artifacts together and identify which requirements are truly supported by the current discovery evidence.
2. If gaps remain, use `research-documentation` to synthesize any additional local documentation or structured notes needed to clarify the requirement set.
3. Instantiate [`artifacts/requirements-specification.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/requirements-specification.md) and [`artifacts/requirements-handoff.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/requirements-handoff.md) into the project workspace if working copies do not already exist.
4. Use `requirements-verification` to determine which requirements are confirmed, separate non-requirements and unresolved items, and populate the instantiated requirements specification artifact, including the verification basis for each verified requirement.
5. If Allium or another behavioral specification is in scope, record whether the verified requirement set confirms, clarifies, or exposes gaps in that specification before treating the BA package as complete.
6. Use `handoff-packaging` to build the instantiated requirements handoff artifact with traceability, risks, dependencies, unresolved questions, stakeholder confirmation status, specification relationship, and downstream decision points.
7. Run [`requirements-specification.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/requirements-specification.check.md), [`requirements-handoff.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/requirements-handoff.check.md), [`traceability.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/traceability.check.md), and [`business-analyst-boundary.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/business-analyst-boundary.check.md) against the instantiated BA chain.
8. If the verified behavior is stable enough for formal specification, use the existing Allium skills to promote or reconcile it deliberately rather than leaving specification work implicit.
9. If the handoff is mature and the next step is implementation planning, use `spec-to-implementation` as a downstream bridge rather than extending BA discovery further.

## Decision Points

- If a requirement does not trace back to a business objective or process need, treat it as unverified.
- If a requirement has no explicit verification basis, treat it as unverified even if it sounds plausible.
- If proposed solutions were mentioned during discovery, keep them separate from confirmed requirements unless they were explicitly validated as requirements.
- If AI-enabled behavior is involved, separate business objectives, acceptance expectations for agent outputs, and AI or agent-specific constraints.
- If the requirement set is stable and behaviorally clear, identify which parts may be ready for Allium promotion.
- If an Allium specification already exists, surface where the verified requirement set confirms it, clarifies it, or reveals a specification gap.
- If stakeholder confirmation is still pending, carry that status into the handoff explicitly rather than implying downstream-ready certainty.

## Validation

- [`requirements-specification.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/requirements-specification.check.md) passes.
- [`requirements-handoff.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/requirements-handoff.check.md) passes.
- [`traceability.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/traceability.check.md) passes.
- [`business-analyst-boundary.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/business-analyst-boundary.check.md) passes.
- The workflow does not drift into delivery management or implementation execution.

## Failure Handling

- Stop and ask for clarification if the requirements cannot be verified from the available discovery evidence.
- Do not treat feature suggestions as confirmed requirements without traceability.
- If the handoff would still require downstream roles to rediscover the business problem, keep the BA workflow open and fill the gaps first.
- If the requirements specification check fails, rework the requirement set with `requirements-verification` and use `research-documentation` if additional evidence is needed.
- If the requirements handoff check fails, repackage the artifact with `handoff-packaging` and route back to `requirements-verification` if the underlying requirement set is still unstable.
- If a traceability or boundary check fails, route remediation to the prior BA artifact that introduced the defect rather than hiding it inside the handoff.

## Notes

This workflow is the bridge between Business Analyst discovery and downstream planning. Use [`spec-to-implementation`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/spec-to-implementation/SKILL.md) only after the BA artifacts are mature.
