# Business Analyst Kickoff

## Purpose

Turn a project kickoff prompt, rough notes, transcript, or prior documentation into a clear discovery baseline centered on the business problem and desired outcome.

## When To Use

- A project is starting and the business problem is not yet crisply defined.
- Stakeholders have offered goals, features, or concerns, but they are not yet organized into a usable discovery artifact.
- Prior notes or transcripts exist and need to be normalized into a reusable kickoff artifact.

## Inputs

- Required: kickoff request, notes, transcript, or existing project context.
- Optional: prior documentation, stakeholder lists, meeting agendas, research sources, and existing local Markdown files.

## Outputs

- Primary artifact type: an instantiated copy of [`artifacts/business-objectives.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/business-objectives.md) in the target project workspace
- Secondary outputs: structured notes, clarified scope boundaries, assumptions, and open questions.

## Skills And Tools

- [`meeting-intelligence`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/meeting-intelligence/SKILL.md) for structuring discovery meetings, agendas, and pre-reads.
- [`meeting-notes-and-actions`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/meeting-notes-and-actions/SKILL.md) when raw notes or transcripts need to be normalized.
- [`research-documentation`](D:/Projects/agoge/skills/research-documentation/SKILL.md) when prior documents or external context need synthesis.
- Local Markdown files in [`artifacts/`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts) and project notes as the default storage/output model.

## Sequence

1. Gather the starting material: kickoff request, notes, transcript, or prior docs, and identify whether the work begins from a live discovery need or existing artifacts.
2. If a discovery meeting needs to be prepared, use `meeting-intelligence` to structure the meeting goal, decision needs, agenda, and pre-read context.
3. If rough notes or a transcript already exist, use `meeting-notes-and-actions` to extract the business problem, decisions, risks, action items, and ambiguities.
4. If multiple existing documents or research sources are involved, use `research-documentation` to synthesize the relevant context into a coherent discovery summary.
5. Instantiate [`artifacts/business-objectives.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/artifacts/business-objectives.md) into the project workspace if a working copy does not already exist.
6. Populate the instantiated business objectives artifact, keeping business objectives, scope boundaries, assumptions, proposed solutions, open questions, and stakeholder confirmation status clearly separated.
7. If stakeholder confirmation has occurred, record the response and any corrections. If it has not occurred yet, record that it is still pending rather than implying confirmation.
8. Run [`business-objectives.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/business-objectives.check.md), [`traceability.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/traceability.check.md), and [`business-analyst-boundary.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/business-analyst-boundary.check.md) against the instantiated artifact and any supporting BA chain that already exists.
9. Confirm that the resulting artifact passes the required checks and is sufficient to support process analysis without inventing missing business facts.

## Decision Points

- If only a prompt exists, structure discovery around open questions and stakeholder gaps before drafting conclusions.
- If a transcript exists, normalize it first rather than drafting the artifact directly from noisy raw material.
- If prior docs conflict, preserve the contradiction as an open question instead of reconciling it silently.
- If stakeholder confirmation has not happened yet, record the gap explicitly and keep the confirmation status pending instead of implying agreement.
- If the project includes AI-enabled or agentic behavior, record business-facing constraints separately from AI or agent-specific constraints.

## Validation

- [`business-objectives.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/business-objectives.check.md) passes.
- [`traceability.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/traceability.check.md) passes when enough of the BA chain exists for it to apply.
- [`business-analyst-boundary.check.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/checks/business-analyst-boundary.check.md) passes.
- The instantiated output is ready to feed [`business-analyst-process-analysis.md`](D:/Projects/agoge/workflows/business-analyst-process-analysis.md).

## Failure Handling

- Stop and ask for more information if the business problem cannot be stated without inventing facts.
- Do not collapse feature requests into confirmed objectives when the underlying need is still unclear.
- If no meaningful context exists, produce a discovery-ready skeleton with explicit gaps instead of a false summary.
- If the primary check fails, rework kickoff framing with `meeting-intelligence`, normalize raw inputs with `meeting-notes-and-actions`, or synthesize scattered context with `research-documentation`.
- If a traceability or boundary check fails, route remediation to the earliest BA artifact or source input that introduced the defect before continuing downstream.

## Notes

This is the default entry workflow for Business Analyst work. Prefer local Markdown artifacts even when external systems exist.
