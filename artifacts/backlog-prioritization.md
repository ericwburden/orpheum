# Backlog Prioritization

## Purpose

Capture the current ordering of candidate work, the rationale behind that ordering, acceptance-oriented conditions, deferred scope, and the tradeoffs that shaped the decision.

Use this artifact after product direction is explicit and before downstream solutioning, planning, or commitment work is treated as ready.

This checked-in file is the canonical template definition. Create an instantiated project copy before filling it out for live Product Owner work.

## Completion Guidance

This artifact is complete when a downstream reader can understand what work is prioritized next, why it is ordered that way, what acceptance or value conditions still matter, and what has been deferred or excluded.

When a scenario is narrowing one bounded delivery slice, this artifact is the primary place to express that current slice choice without rewriting broader product direction.

## Decision Scope

State which backlog slice, initiative set, release horizon, or planning window this prioritization covers.

If the current work is a bounded delivery slice, say so explicitly here rather than collapsing enduring product-direction scope upward into slice language.

## Prioritized Work Set

List the currently prioritized initiatives, features, slices, or work items in order.

Make the selected next slice explicit when one bounded slice is the current planning unit.

## Ordering Rationale

Explain why the work is ordered this way, including value, urgency, risk reduction, learning value, customer need, or dependency considerations.

## Acceptance-Oriented Conditions

Describe the must-have outcomes, guardrails, or acceptance conditions that materially affect what should be considered complete or valuable.

## Deferred Or Excluded Scope

Identify what is intentionally not being prioritized now and why.

## Sequencing And Dependency Notes

Call out any sequencing assumptions, external dependencies, or readiness conditions that materially affect the ordering.

## Stakeholder Tensions And Tradeoffs

Describe the major conflicts, tradeoffs, or competing requests that shaped the prioritization posture.

## Reprioritization Triggers

List the evidence changes, approval events, market signals, release learnings, or delivery outcomes that should trigger another prioritization pass.

## Recommended Next Step

Describe the immediate next step, such as architecture work, planning, additional discovery, or decision review.
