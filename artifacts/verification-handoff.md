# Verification Handoff

## Purpose

Capture the downstream-ready verification summary, evidence status, residual risks, readiness conditions, and unresolved issues that implementation, review, or release-adjacent roles need to continue the work.

Use this artifact to hand verification downstream without requiring later roles to reconstruct the evidence chain or review logic from earlier notes.

This checked-in file is the canonical template definition. Create an instantiated project copy before filling it out for live QA / Verification Lead work.

## Completion Guidance

This artifact is complete when downstream roles can understand what was verified, how strong the evidence is, the review status of the verification package, the main gaps or hotspots that still matter, and the next decision points that remain.

## Handoff Summary

Provide a short summary of what verification package is being handed off and why.

## Verification Summary

Summarize the verification strategy, coverage state, major evidence signals, and the main confidence limits that still matter.

## Review Status And Key Findings

Summarize the current evidence review status, the most important findings, and any material conditions on downstream use.

## Evidence Provenance Summary

Summarize the most important provenance details that downstream roles need in order to trust the verification judgment.

Capture:

- which revision, build, run, or artifact versions the verification package applies to
- which environments or contexts the strongest evidence came from
- any freshness limits or representativeness caveats that still matter downstream

## Readiness Ownership And Conditions

If the verification package is not simply ready, make the ownership and clearance conditions explicit.

Capture:

- the decision owner or approver for the current readiness state
- any condition owners responsible for required follow-up, clarification, approval, or evidence generation
- the conditions that must be satisfied before downstream work should treat the package as fully ready

## Coverage And Evidence Hotspots

List the requirements, interfaces, architectural assumptions, implementation slices, or risk areas where downstream roles should pay particular attention to verification status.

Make the most important blocking, conditional, and informational hotspots explicit.

## Residual Risks And Weak Evidence

Identify the most material gaps, contradictory signals, partial coverage, or confidence limits still in play.

## Specification Relationship

If Allium or another behavioral specification materially constrained verification, summarize that relationship here.

Capture:

- which specifications were treated as verification anchors
- where the verification package relies on specification-to-implementation alignment
- which specification gaps, conflicts, or unstable behaviors still matter downstream
- whether any verification issue should route back to upstream specification, architecture, planning, or implementation work rather than be solved in release operations

## Scope Exclusions And Deferred Coverage

Summarize the work that this verification pass intentionally excludes, defers, or leaves for a later phase, environment, or approval stage.

## Reverification Triggers

List the changes or events that should invalidate the current verification judgment and force the package to be reviewed again.

Capture:

- which code, configuration, interface, environment, data, or rollout changes should trigger re-verification
- whether the trigger invalidates the whole package or only a specific scope area
- who should decide whether a lighter targeted re-check is enough versus a full re-review

## Recommended Downstream Consumers

Identify which roles should consume this handoff, such as:

- implementation engineer
- code reviewer
- release or handoff manager
- project or product owner when a human readiness decision is needed

## Next Decision Points

Describe the most important downstream verification-adjacent decisions that remain, without turning this artifact into a release checklist or defect tracker.
