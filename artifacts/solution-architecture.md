# Solution Architecture

## Purpose

Capture the proposed solution shape for a validated problem space, including architectural drivers, system boundary, major components, interfaces, integrations, constraints, and risks.

Use this artifact after business objectives, process needs, and requirements are stable enough to support architectural design.

This checked-in file is the canonical template definition. Create an instantiated project copy before filling it out for live Solution Architect work.

## Completion Guidance

This artifact is complete when a downstream reader can understand the intended system shape, why it was chosen, what constraints it must respect, where the important interfaces and contract assumptions lie, and where the major architectural risks and boundaries sit without inferring them from chat context.

This artifact should preserve enduring system architecture across downstream slice-selection work unless the broader architecture itself has materially changed.

## Problem And Scope

Summarize the problem space and the part of the system this architecture is addressing.

Make it explicit whether this scope is whole-system, subsystem, or another enduring architectural boundary that should outlive the current delivery slice.

Do not silently narrow this artifact to the currently selected slice unless the broader architecture direction has actually changed.

## Input Context

Reference the business objectives, process analysis, requirements specification, requirements handoff, and any existing behavioral specifications this architecture depends on.

## Architectural Drivers

List the decision drivers that shape the architecture, such as scale, reliability, compliance, latency, operational complexity, trust boundaries, or integration constraints.

## System Boundary

Describe what is inside the solution boundary and what remains outside it.

Keep whole-system or enduring subsystem boundaries distinct from the current implementation slice when those operate at different scope layers.

## Major Components And Responsibilities

List the major components, services, modules, or subsystems and what each one is responsible for.

## Major Flows

Describe the key data flows, control flows, or orchestration flows the system must support.

## Interfaces And Contracts

Describe the important interfaces or boundary seams the architecture depends on, including:

- who owns each boundary
- what crosses it
- contract expectations or assumptions
- important failure, retry, timeout, or fallback expectations when they matter materially

## Integrations And External Dependencies

List the major integrations, external systems, and dependency assumptions the architecture relies on.

## Constraints

Capture the technical, policy, platform, operational, or delivery constraints that materially shape the architecture.

## Decisions Made

Capture the architecture choices that should be treated as already selected rather than still under open design discussion.

For each decision, capture:

- the decision statement
- why it was chosen now
- the architectural consequence
- what downstream roles should preserve

## Locked Constraints

Capture the constraints, boundaries, or interface commitments that downstream roles should treat as non-negotiable unless a human explicitly reopens them.

Use this section to preserve enduring architectural seams rather than recasting them as slice-local planning decisions.

## Specification Relationship

If Allium or another behavioral specification is in scope, record how the proposed architecture relates to it.

Capture:

- which specification or specification areas materially constrain the architecture
- which parts of the architecture assume or preserve already-specified behavior
- where the architecture depends on behavior that is missing, ambiguous, unstable, or still requires upstream specification work
- any architectural consequences of specification gaps or conflicts that downstream roles should understand

## Architecture Fitness Criteria

Describe the measurable or observable criteria that indicate whether the architecture is succeeding, such as:

- performance or latency targets
- reliability or recovery expectations
- security or control expectations
- operability, observability, or supportability expectations
- correctness or boundary-behavior expectations that verification work should test

Keep these criteria architecture-relevant and verifiable. Do not turn them into implementation tasks.

## Trust Boundaries And Human Control Points

If the system includes AI-enabled or agentic behavior, describe the relevant trust boundaries, escalation points, approval steps, or human intervention expectations.

## Risks And Open Questions

List architectural risks, tradeoffs still under discussion, and questions that remain unresolved.
