# Implementation Package Handoff

## Purpose

Capture the downstream-ready implementation summary, change footprint, evidence posture, review status, and revalidation triggers that code review, verification, or release-adjacent roles need in order to continue the work safely.

Use this artifact to hand implementation downstream without requiring later roles to reconstruct the implementation story from diffs, local runs, or scattered notes.

This checked-in file is the canonical template definition. Create an instantiated project copy before filling it out for live Implementation Engineer work.

## Completion Guidance

This artifact is complete when downstream roles can understand what was implemented, what evidence exists, what the readiness review concluded, what still remains risky or unresolved, and what should happen next.

## Related Checks

- Primary: [`implementation-package-handoff.check.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/checks/implementation-package-handoff.check.md)
- Cross-cutting: [`implementation-traceability.check.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/checks/implementation-traceability.check.md)
- Cross-cutting: [`implementation-engineer-boundary.check.md`](D:/Projects/orpheum/checks/implementation-engineer-boundary.check.md)

## Handoff Summary

Provide a short summary of what implementation package is being handed off and why.

## Implemented Scope Summary

Summarize what implementation scope was completed, what was only partial, and what was intentionally deferred.

## Change Footprint Summary

Summarize the most important affected code areas, interfaces, configurations, migrations, data surfaces, or integration seams that downstream roles should pay attention to.

## Evidence Posture Summary

Summarize the strongest local validation signals, the weakest evidence areas, and the checks that were skipped, unavailable, or failed.

## Review Status And Key Findings

Summarize the implementation-package readiness review state, the most important findings, and any material conditions on downstream use.

Keep this separate from future independent code review findings or downstream verification judgments.

## Known Issues And Residual Risks

List the defects, blockers, weak evidence, or residual implementation risks that downstream roles should preserve explicitly.

## Specification Relationship

If Allium or another behavioral specification materially constrained this implementation, summarize that relationship here.

Capture:

- which specifications or spec areas materially governed the implementation
- where the implementation may still depend on spec clarification or drift checking
- whether any issue should route back to upstream specification, architecture, or planning work rather than be solved downstream

## Revalidation Triggers

List the changes or conditions that should invalidate this implementation package or require targeted re-checking downstream.

Capture:

- which code, interface, config, environment, dependency, or data changes should trigger revalidation
- whether the trigger affects the whole package or only a specific area
- who should decide whether a light targeted re-check is enough versus a broader review

## Recommended Downstream Consumers

Identify which roles should consume this handoff, such as:

- code reviewer
- QA or verification lead
- release or handoff manager
- technical planner or solution architect when upstream issues were exposed

## Next Decision Points

Describe the most important downstream implementation-adjacent decisions that remain, without turning this artifact into a defect tracker or release checklist.
