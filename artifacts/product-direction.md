# Product Direction

## Purpose

Capture the current product goal, outcome focus, target users or stakeholders, value framing, and scope boundaries that should guide downstream solutioning and prioritization.

Use this artifact before detailed architecture, implementation planning, or release decisions are treated as settled.

This checked-in file is the canonical template definition. Create an instantiated project copy before filling it out for live Product Owner work.

## Completion Guidance

This artifact is complete when a downstream reader can understand what outcome the product is trying to achieve, for whom, why it matters now, what constraints still apply, and what broad priority themes should guide the next decisions.

This artifact should preserve enduring product posture across downstream slice-selection work unless the product itself has materially changed.

## Decision Scope

State which product area, initiative, release horizon, customer segment, or decision window this direction covers.

Make it explicit whether this scope is whole-product, initiative-level, or otherwise enduring across multiple slices.

Do not silently narrow this artifact to the currently selected delivery slice unless the broader product direction has actually changed.

## Validated Inputs

Reference the business objectives, process analysis, requirements, feedback signals, release learnings, verification findings, and other supporting context used to shape this direction.

## Product Goal Or Outcome Focus

Describe the primary outcome the current product direction is trying to achieve and why it matters now.

## Target Users, Stakeholders, Or Beneficiaries

Identify who is expected to benefit from this direction and whose needs are materially shaping the choice.

## Value Hypotheses And Success Signals

Summarize the expected value, business impact, user impact, or risk reduction and how success would be recognized.

## Acceptance Intent And Behavioral Guardrails

Describe the must-have outcomes, user-facing guardrails, or behavior-sensitive conditions that downstream roles should preserve.

Make it explicit when this is product-level acceptance framing rather than a full behavioral specification or verification plan.

## Scope Boundaries And Non-Goals

Make the intended scope, explicit exclusions, and current non-goals visible.

## Constraints And Decision Drivers

Describe the business, regulatory, contractual, operational, trust-boundary, or timing constraints that materially affect product direction.

## Priority Themes

List the major themes or categories of work that should guide what gets prioritized next.

Keep these themes broad enough to guide multiple backlog choices when the product posture is broader than one bounded slice.

## Open Questions And Decision Needs

Record unresolved product questions, missing evidence, or approvals that still affect the direction.

## Recommended Next Step

Describe the immediate next step, such as backlog prioritization, architecture handoff, additional discovery, or product review.
