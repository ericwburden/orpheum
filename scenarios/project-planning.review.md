# Project Planning Scenario Review

## Purpose

Capture the current review posture for the reusable `Project Planning` scenario before it is treated as ready for downstream adoption or tailoring.

## Review Scope

Scenario in scope:

- [project-planning.definition.md](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/scenarios/project-planning.definition.md)
- [project-planning.integration-map.md](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/scenarios/project-planning.integration-map.md)

Lifecycle window:

- validated discovery and product direction through reviewed architecture and implementation planning

## Reviewed Inputs

- the Scenario Designer role package
- the participating role definitions for Business Analyst, Product Owner, Solution Architect, Technical Planner, and Security / Compliance Specialist
- the role-owned workflows referenced in the integration map
- the scenario recommendations note in [scenario-recommendations.md](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/scenario-recommendations.md)
- participant-readiness evidence recorded in [solution-architect-skill-sourcing.md](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/solution-architect-skill-sourcing.md) and [technical-planner-skill-sourcing.md](C:/Users/ericw/Projects/orpheum/notes/technical-planner-skill-sourcing.md)

## Overall Assessment

The scenario is a strong first implementation candidate because it composes the repository's best-developed upstream planning roles into a coherent reusable phase without forcing implementation, review, verification, or release work into the same scenario.

The current package is coherent and should be treated as ready for downstream adoption and tailoring with explicit limits.

## Decision Status

`ready`

Basis for judgment:

- the role participation is explicit
- the participating role packages are now aligned with the scenario's handoff contracts
- the optional security/compliance branch is explicit rather than hidden
- the scenario stays inside planning-phase scope and does not collapse into live project management
- the underlying role-package refinements required by the earlier verification pass have been addressed without introducing new scenario-only skills
- the role-package evidence for Solution Architect and Technical Planner hardening is now preserved explicitly instead of being left as implicit branch history

## Integration Risks And Failure Modes

- The Product Owner branch may be skipped too casually if teams over-assume that validated requirements already imply settled product direction.
- The optional Security / Compliance Specialist branch may be invoked inconsistently until stronger local trigger guidance emerges from usage.
- Scenario adoption guidance must keep the optional Security / Compliance branch positioned before or alongside architecture and planning when it materially constrains them, rather than treating it like a trailing packaging step.
- Teams may over-read the scenario as a full project lifecycle rather than as a pre-implementation planning phase if downstream boundaries are not preserved.

## Conditions And Remediation Decisions

- Preserve the distinction between reusable scenario structure and live project execution planning.
- Preserve explicit product-direction review before architecture depends on it.
- Preserve explicit architecture review before implementation planning depends on it.
- Preserve the rule that optional Security / Compliance participation should shape architecture or planning before those outputs are treated as settled.
- Preserve the role-package evidence that materially explains why Solution Architect and Technical Planner are ready to participate in this scenario.
- If repeated usage reveals ambiguity around the optional security/compliance branch, strengthen the trigger rules in a future scenario hardening pass.

## Follow-Up Owners

- Scenario Designer
  - owns future strengthening of scenario-specific trigger rules and routing clarity
- Role Builder
  - owns any future changes that require underlying role-package refinement rather than scenario-only edits

## Revisit Triggers

- a new delivery-manager or Scrum-Master-like role is added
- secure-delivery scenarios are implemented and establish stronger default security/compliance trigger rules
- repeated use shows that Product Owner participation needs a sharper minimum entry rule
- repeated use shows that the scenario needs a stronger adoption or tailoring guide

## Recommended Next Step

Use the Project Planning handoff artifact to package this scenario for downstream adoption in `scenarios/`.
